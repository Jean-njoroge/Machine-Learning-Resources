# Machine-Learning-Resources

This repository is a knowledge and learning hub that contains all resources relating to machine learning

## Introduction to Machine Learning

### Types of Machine Learnng


#### 1. [Supervise Learning Machine Learning ](https://github.com/Jean-njoroge/Machine-Learning-Resources/tree/master/supervised_learning)
Folder contains information on Supervised learning approaches, how it worked and type of algorithms used in supervised learning
In a supervised learning model, the algorithm learns on a labeled dataset, providing an answer key that the algorithm can use to evaluate its accuracy on training data.

 #### 2. Unsupervised Machine Learning
 #### 3. Semi - Supervised Machine Learning
