# Machine-Learning-Resources

This repository is a knowledge and learning hub that contains all resources relating to machine learning


## Introduction to Machine Learning

### Types of Machine Learnng


#### 1. [Supervised Learning Machine Learning ](https://github.com/Jean-njoroge/Machine-Learning-Resources/tree/master/supervised_learning)
 * Folder contains information on Supervised learning approaches, how it workes and type of algorithms used in supervised learning
 * Algorithms in supervised learning learning on a **labeled dataset**, containing keys from which evaluation process will be based on
 
 #### Supervised Machine learning methods
* Linear Regression

 #### 2. [Unsupervised Machine Learning]
 Algorithm in unsupervised learning are based in **unalabled data** trying to make sense through extraction of features and petterns without supervision
 
 #### 3. [Semi - Supervised Machine Learning]
 #### 4. [Reinforcement Learning]
