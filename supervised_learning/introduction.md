# Supervised Learnging

## 1. What is Supervised Learning 
With supervised machine learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data.

If you’re learning a task under supervision, someone is present judging whether you’re getting the right answer. Similarly, in supervised learning, that means having a full set of labeled data while training an algorithm.

Fully labeled means that each example in the training dataset is tagged with the answer the algorithm should come up with on its own. So, a labeled dataset of flower images would tell the model which photos were of roses, daisies and daffodils. When shown a new image, the model compares it to the training examples to predict the correct label.
