## What is Linear Regression
Linear regression is the most well known and well understood algorithms in statistics and machine learning.Linear regression was developed in the field of statistics. It is studied as a model for understanding the relationship between input and output numerical variables, but has been borrowed by machine learning. It is both a statistical algorithm and a machine learning algorithm.

The objective of performing a regression is to build a model to express the relation between the response y ∈ Rn and a combination of one or more (independent) vari- ables xi ∈ Rn . [1] The model allows us to predict the response y from the variables. The simplest model which can be considered is a linear model, where the response y depends linearly on the d variables xi :

## Different Techniques of Linear Regression
Different techniques can be used to prepare or train the linear regression equation from data, the most common of which is called Ordinary Least Squares
