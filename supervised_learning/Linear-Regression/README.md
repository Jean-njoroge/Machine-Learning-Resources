# Linear Regression
Linear regression is the most well known and well understood algorithms in statistics and machine learning.inear regression was developed in the field of statistics and is studied as a model for understanding the relationship between input and output numerical variables, but has been borrowed by machine learning. It is both a statistical algorithm and a machine learning algorithm.

The objective of performing a regression is to build a model to express the relation between the response y ∈ Rn and a combination of one or more (independent) vari- ables xi ∈ Rn . [1] The model allows us to predict the response y from the variables. The simplest model which can be considered is a linear model, where the response y depends linearly on the d variables xi :
