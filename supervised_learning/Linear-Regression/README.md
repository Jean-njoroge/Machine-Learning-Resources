# Linear Regression
The objective of performing a regression is to build a model to express the relation between the response y ∈ Rn and a combination of one or more (independent) vari- ables xi ∈ Rn . [1] The model allows us to predict the response y from the variables. The simplest model which can be considered is a linear model, where the response y depends linearly on the d variables xi :
