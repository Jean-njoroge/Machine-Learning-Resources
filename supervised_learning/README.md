## What is Supervised Learning 

Supervised learning is typically done in the context of:
1. **Classification**, when we want to map input to output labels, or
2. **Regression** when we want to map input to a continuous output

* With supervised machine learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data.
* Fully labeled means that each example in the training dataset is tagged with the answer the algorithm should come up with on its own. 
* So, a labeled dataset of flower images would tell the model which photos were of roses, daisies and daffodils. When shown a new image, the model compares it to the training examples to predict the correct label.
